SMark
=====

SMark is a grade scaling utility which can be used to scale a set of numbers to
a target arithmetic mean (or other metric) while keeping the lower and upper
bounds.

The target application of this script is for teachers to be able to scale the
marks of students easily without worrying about giving students over 100%.

**Why not just write better assessments which result in whatever grade
distribution you want?**

I am a believer that many assessments should be written such that the average
is around 50% as this allows for students to have the maximal space to
demonstrate their grasp of the subject. Assessments with averages far from the
middle usually have a smaller deviation in marks, which causes small changes in
performance to have a larger impact in one student's ranking in the class.

However, this is not a proclamation that all assessments should be standardized
to an average of 50%. Many assessments, especially ones regarding safety
protocols, should require a very high (if not perfect) grasp on the material
to be deemed acceptable.
